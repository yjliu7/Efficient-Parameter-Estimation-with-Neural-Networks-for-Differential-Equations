# Efficient-Parameter-Estimation-with-Neural-Networks-for-Differential-Equations

Python (PyTorch) implementation of Efficient Parameter Estimation with Neural Networks for Differential Equations

## Installation

Our code depends on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep learning framework.
First install a proper version of PyTorch following the
[official documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Some parts of our code are built upon the Python package [neurodiffeq](https://github.com/NeuroDiffGym/neurodiffeq).

## Running Examples

The code files for the numerical experiments presented in the article are provided in `experiments`. Simply run the Python files in order in each subdirectory. The generated plots used by the article are also provided.
